Computational Neuroscience Library
=======================
* The goal of this project is to
    1.  Model the voltage of Neurons using the Forward Euler Method
    2.  Allow for as much code reuse as possible by using function handles to model different differential equations with the same forward Euler function
    3.  Force me to practice modularity by using functions in a read only library folder
* Project Notes
    * I keep a library of submitted code which is useful in ensuring backwards compatibility
    * Error helperhttps://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/97825-why-do-i-get-the-error-output-argument-variable-and-maybe-others-not-assigned-during-call-t
* Quick Start

    * Startup File

      * If you have a [Matlab Startup File](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html), past the code from startup.m into it
      * Otherwise, paste the startup.m file in the Matlab directory, for me it's C:\Users\jsmit\Documents\MATLAB

    * Provided Code is from

      * [Paul Miller's online code]( http://people.brandeis.edu/~pmiller/TEXTBOOK/index.html)
